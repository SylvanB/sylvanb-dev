# My first ever post!

Hopefully this is the beginning of a long journey of learning and shitposting. 
This site has been remade about 3 times in serveral horrible ways, before I finally 
stumbled upon [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io) - a static site generater written in Rust!

By using Cobalt I was able to recreate my entire personal site in about an hour thanks its fairly simple
API and `.liquid` templating.
